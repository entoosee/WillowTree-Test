Instructions:

I was not able to get the code to work on my home machine but I am still going to include the code to show what I attempted and what you would do to install Ruby on your machine.

Please download the following things to get the Ruby test to function properly...

https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ Ruby+Devkit 2.4.4-1 (x64) 

https://www.chromium.org/Home Chromium  (For Chrome use only)

Install Ruby first and when the prompt comes up, please type in 1,2,3 then press enter.

Once this is installed successfully, put the Chromium.exe file in the Ruby bin directory.

Then verify you have the following gems and if you do not, please download from https://rubygems.org/

require "bundler"
require "rubygems"
#require "webdrivers"
require "page-object" 
require "rake"
require "benchmark"
require "capybara"
require "rubocop"
require "ruport"
require "rspec"
require "capybara/rspec"
require "capybara-screenshot/rspec" 
# require "selenium-webdriver"
require 'win32ole'
require "watir"
require "watir-webdriver-performance"
require "data_magic"
require "./PortalURLData.rb"
